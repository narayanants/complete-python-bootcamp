Solutions for Exercise questions:
==================================

1) What are Strings,List, Dictionary, Tuples?

    String - Ordered Sequence of characters
    Lists - Ordered Sequence of Objects (Mutable)
    Tuples - Ordered Sequence of Objects(Immutable)
    Dictionary - K:V pairing that is unordered

Numbers:
========

2) Write an equation that uses multiplication, division, an exponent, addition, and subtraction that is equal to 100.25.

(60 + (10 ** 2) / 4 * 7) - 134.75

3) Answer these 3 questions without typing code. Then type code to check your answer.

What is the value of the expression 4 * (6 + 5) = 44

What is the value of the expression 4 * 6 + 5 = 29

What is the value of the expression 4 + 6 * 5 = 34


4) What is the type of the result of the expression 3 + 1.5 + 4?
A) float

5) What would you use to find a numberâ€™s square root, as well as its square?
A) 
    100 ** 0.5 = 10  (Square Root)
    10 ** 2 (Square)


Strings:
========

6) Given the string 'hello' give an index command that returns 'e'. Enter your code in the cell below:

A) str[1]

7) Reverse the string 'hello' using slicing:

A) str = "Hello"
   print(str[::-1])

8) Given the string hello, give two methods of producing the letter 'o' using indexing.

A)  str = "Hello"
    print(str[-1])
    print(str[4])


Lists:
======

9) Build this list [0,0,0] two separate ways.

A)  list = [0,0,0]
    print(list)

    list = [0] * 3
    print(list)


10) Reassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'goodbye' instead:
   
A)  list3 = [1,2,[3,4,'hello']]
    list3[2][2]= 'goodbye'
    print(list3)

11) Sort the list below:
A) 
    list4 = [5,3,4,6,1]
    list4.sort()
        OR 
    sorted(list4)
    print(sorted(list4))


Dictionary:
===========

12) Using keys and indexing, grab the 'hello' from the following dictionaries:

A) 
    d = {'simple_key':'hello'}
    print(d['simple_key'])

   d = {'k1':[{'nest_key':['this is deep',['hello']]}]}
   print(d['k1'][0]['nest_key'][1][0])

    d = {'k1':[1,2,{'k2':['this is tricky',{'tough':[1,2,['hello']]}]}]}
    print(d['k1'][2]['k2'][1]['tough'][2][0])

14) Can you sort a dictionary? Why or why not?

A) No! Because normal dictionaries are mappings not a sequence

Tuples:
========

15)  What is the major difference between tuples and lists?

A) Lists are Mutable
    Tuples are Immutable

16) How do you create a tuple?

A) Using () Parenthesis


Sets:
======

17) What is unique about a set?

A) They don't allow duplicate items

18) Use a set to find the unique values of the list below:

A)  list5 = [1,2,2,33,4,4,11,22,3,3,2]
    print(set(list5))

Booleans:
==========

19) What will be the resulting Boolean of the following pieces of code (answer fist then check by typing it in!)

    2 > 3 = False
    3 <= 2 = False
    3 == 2.0 = False
    3.0 == 3 = True
    4**0.5 != 2 False
    

    l_one = [1,2,[3,4]]
    l_two = [1,2,{'k1':4}]

    print(l_one[2][0] >= l_two[2]['k1']) // False
